# Scientific-Calculator

A digital calculator designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, act as a digital pocket calculator.

features:-
* Include exponents, log, natural log (ln), trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions.

* it can solve mathematical problems like factorials, permutations, and combinations can find nth root.

* Can solve mathematical equations up to 14 decimals.

The calculator is manually designed, which means you have to write the equation correctly. For example, in the FX and in the TI calculator, if you type 9Cos45, it automatically applies 9 X Cos45 and gives 6.36, but in this, you have to write 9 X Cos45, or it will give the wrong answer. The equation should be proper.
